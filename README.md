=================

Shoe marketplace app with user signin/validation, created in ~5 hrs for a Coding Dojo Black Belt exam.

Technology used: Ruby on Rails3, SQLite, JQuery, Bootstrap3, simple_form.

Users signin and can view items for sale by other users, and can create/edit/remove their own listings.

A user dashboard shows the user his/her open items for sale, as well as the successfully closed sales 
and purchases (with individual and total dollar values).  

A user can also view the list of all users, including their dashboards and listed items.  

Users with admin status can nullify sales, remove items or users, and promote/demote others to admin.
